      <p className='p_text'>This is an experimental coin that will try and secure a $50k market cap and after that a rising floor through a buyback system, an anti-jeet and a honeypot system.
Now do not be worried about your investment.<br/><br/><br/>
It is fully renowned and the liquidity will be burned forever once it is above $50k market cap. However if we dont reach the $50k market cap within a week the liquidity will be divided amongst the buyers according to their current holdings.</p>
